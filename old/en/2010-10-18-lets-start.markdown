In Hungarian there is an idiom about "_every beginning is hard_". Yes probably it is. And it's also hard to write the first post on a new blog.

**About me: **I am working as a Java architect/consultant/programmer in Hungary (currently). My mother tongue is Java but I am interesting a lot of other things. Usually I have full of ideas. I would like to have enough time to implement as much thing as I can. And always learning.

This blog wouldn't like to say the truth or provide good and lightening tutorials. But It could be a diary about technologies what I am interesting about, and questions what I would like to solve. And anything else from me.

**About my plans:** I also have some formar plans.



	
  1. _Learning new languages._ As I wrote my first language is Java, but I think (as in real life) you are more if you know more languages. So much things could be learned from aspects of other languages. So I would like to write more code in Ruby and Python (and later probably in Scala).

	
  2. _Learning more algorithms_. But algorithms shouldn't be only theory. So my plan is solve old problems from [code jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html) and [challenge24](http://www.challenge24thelegend.com/2010/). (Solutions will be [here](http://github.com/elek/codejam).)

	
  3. _NoSQL, Android. _I also have some unfinished experimental projects (simple Android applications, NoSQL based OSM server, etc). I also would like to improve these.
