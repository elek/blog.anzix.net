I have never found the right personal finance management application for me. I tried the gnucash, but it wasn't comfortable enough (but
I can imagine that I did't read enough documentation to learn in.).

My priorities were:

* importing transaction logs from my multiple bank account (mostly csv)
* classifyng the transactions during the import automatically based on regular expression
* handle different currencies (automatically convert for the reports based on predefine rate tables)

Now I am created a simple static site generator for personal finance reports. It's enogh to copy the exported csv files to subdirectories, create JSON configurations files,
and define some pattern to classify the transactions.

Simple demo site is [here](http://blog.anzix.net/rahakott), source is on the [github](https://github.com/elek/rahakott). (Dont' expect too much, still a draft, uploaded only for archivation)

Used libraries:

* Twitter bootsrap (like++)
* [Datatables] (htp://datatables.net)
* GJon
* OpenCsv
* Freemarker
