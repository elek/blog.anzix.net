Just a short notes about searching in the central maven repository:

I have some utility artifact in central (thanks for the OSS hosting of Sonatype). The last one was release at 27th of January. I checked them in maven repository search engines. The results are:

[mvnrepository.com](http://mvnrepository.com/) -- no result

[search.mvnsearch.org](http://search.mvnsearch.org/) -- no result

[www.jarvana.com](http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/) -- only older (1 month old) artifacts were found

[maven.ozacc.com](http://maven.ozacc.com/) -- nothing was found

**In the brand new  [mavencentral.sonatype.com](http://mavencentral.sonatype.com) - everything were found well**

Yes, Sonatype has a good position because they are also hosting the central repository itself.  But they made the job very well. I hope it always will be such updated in the future too.
