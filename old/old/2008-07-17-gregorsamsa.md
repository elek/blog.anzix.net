/**
     * As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself
     * transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard,
     * as it were armour plated, back, and if he lifted his head a little he
     * could see his big, brown belly divided into stiff, arched segments, on
     * top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about
     * to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin
     * compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.
     * "What has happened to me?", he thought. It was no dream....
